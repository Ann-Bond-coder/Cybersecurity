# Electronic digital signature

_Using MS CryptoAPI cryptographic interfaces, create an application 
that allows you to sign files and verify the signature of signed files 
according to the following scheme._

**Sign.cpp** - the code of signing the document.  
**Verify.cpp** - the code of verifying the signature.   
**Source.cpp** - startup file.  
**Header.h** - file containing header files and function declarations.
